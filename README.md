# projet_robot

The aim of this project was to program a robot to adapt to its environment using sensors. In pairs, we coded in embedded C an electronic board we had previously assembled.

The robot had to behave as follows: 
- detection of an obstacle by infinite 180Â° scan
- Targeted advance of one meter towards the obstacle
- Robot stop
- Possibility of repeating the process via remote control
